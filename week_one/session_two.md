#### Objectives
-   Review Data Type Fundamentals (strings and arrays)
-   Methods for approaching problems with code


## Strings and Arrays
-   What are strings?
-   What are arrays?
-   An overview of properties


## Approaching a Problem
-   Nth-to-Last
Return the element that is N-from-arrayâ€™s-end. Given ([5,2,3,6,4,9,7],3), return 4. If the array is too short, return null.

-   Zip It
Create a standalone function that accepts two arrays and combines their values sequentially into a new array, at alternating indices starting with first array. Extra values from either array should be included afterward. Given [1,2] and [10,20,30,40], return new array containing [1,10,2,20,30,40].

-   Reverse Word Order
Create a function that, given a string of words (with spaces), returns new string with words in reverse sequence. 
Given "This is a test", return "test a is This".

-   Unique Letters
Return only the unique characters from a given string. Specifically, omit all instances of a (case-sensitive) character if it appears more than once, respecting spaces and punctuation. Given "Snap! Crackle! Poop!", return "SnCrcklePp".
